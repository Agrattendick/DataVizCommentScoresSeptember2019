# Effects of Hiding Comment Scores in /r/formula1
# r/dataisbeautiful's DataViz Battle for September 2019

## Background
For september 2019 Reddit's r/dataisbeautiful's DataViz Battle's dataset deals with the effects of hiding scores in Reddit's r/formula1.

## Data Collection
This dataset is large. Not sure how to import it. Even if copy/paste into excel was possible each line is one cell. While that's not impossible to deal with that seems a pointless step. 

Look into scraping the data.
